## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on finding new ideas, inspirations, and projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SwiftUI terminology — things like modifiers, properties, and all those little magic details.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on animations built with TypeScript and apps using SwiftUI.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Authentication — like building login systems, user accounts, and secure access.
- 💬 Ask me about front-end, back-end, or anything related to programming.
- 📫 How to reach me: feel free to reach out via GitHub!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My head explodes when I think too much — but I keep doing it anyway!
